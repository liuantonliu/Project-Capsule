This project creates a virtual closet for people who has a hard time keeping track of their clothes or can't decide what to wear
As university students with minimal spare time outside of school, a limited budged, and events to attend that require a specific dress code (e.g., formal), we are looking for good, convenient, and sustainable outfits from our closet to wear.
Project Capsule provides the ability to manage one's wardrobe virtually, recommends quick/good outfit ideas based on user inputting keywords (e.g., casual, formal), encourages donation of clothing, provides access to community closets containing donated clothing.
